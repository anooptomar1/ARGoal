This is the contribute.md of my project. Great to have you here. Here are a few ways you can help make this project better!

# Contribute.md

## Team members

Hello. My name is Peter Hu, of App Doctor Hu, and I am he owner of the project. 

## Learn & listen

Since this repo does not have a forum feature, for general discussion please refer to this "issue" which will serve as a running list of questions and answers:
https://github.com/peterxhu/ARGoal/issues/2
I can also be reached at app.doctor.hu@gmail.com

## Adding new features

This section includes advice on how to build new features for the project & what kind of process it includes. 

* This is how we like people to add new features:   
Before any code change, please create an issue. Certain issues may be by design, some of them may be legitimate, but discussion in the issues section is hugely important.
Once an issue has been verified, create a branch off of master with the following syntax: 
ARGoal-[issue number]-[initials]_[new feature] or ARGoal-15-PH_update-for-swift5
https://github.com/peterxhu/ARGoal/issues

* Here are some specifics on the coding style we prefer:   
Please keep it neat. Any code that is up for consideration to merge must clear these three checks:
1) Please make sure it builds - basic stuff
2) No analyzer warnings, build-time warnings, or run-time warnings (Xcode -> Product)
3) Linter: https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint. Should at least pass SwiftLint 0.12, but passing the most updated one (0.21 at time of writing) is preferable 

* This is how you send your pull request:                  
* You should include the following tests: 
For any utility function that is introduced, please have a unit test for it in the ARGoalTests target.
* These are the updates we hope you make to the changelog: 
Note how there are lines with: ## [Unreleased] and ## 1.0.0, ## 1.1.0, etc
For every merged PR, please update the changelog in the [Unreleased] section. I will handle moving features in the [Unreleased] section into the appropriate release version sections.

Donâ€™t get discouraged! We estimate that the response time from the
maintainers should range from 3 days to a week at the very latest. 

# Bug triage

* You can help us diagnose and fix existing bugs by asking and providing answers for the following:

  * Is the bug reproducible as explained?   
  * Is it reproducible in other environments (for instance, on different browsers or devices)?   
  * Are the steps to reproduce the bug clear? If not, can you describe how you might reproduce it?  
  * What tags should the bug have?  
  * Is this bug something you have run into? Would you appreciate it being looked into faster?
